Hey, I’m [Mahesh Ravariya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mravariya/), a community builder, STEM educator, and tech enthusiast who has worn multiple hats, from community manager and hackathon operations to computer science educator. My journey has been fueled by curiosity, a passion for simplifying complexity, and a commitment to empowering others through technology.

I thrive at the intersection of people and innovation, mentoring students, guiding developers, and creating engaging learning experiences. Whether it's logistics or leadership, coding or coaching, I believe in breaking barriers and building bridges. My mission? To help individuals and communities unlock their potential through knowledge, collaboration, and creativity.
