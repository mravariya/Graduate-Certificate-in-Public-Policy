# The Two-Term Exam Plan in CBSE

***

### Abstract

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has introduced a two-term exam system from the 2025-2026 academic year, a major development that changes the face of education in India. I am a teacher with strong roots in the vibrant streams of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Computer Science (CS). I have seen how educational reforms, particularly those that touch upon assessments, affect learners and the wider education economy. This essay examines the possibilities and difficulties of the two-term exam system, particularly in its ability to alleviate student stress, enhance retention, and its economic costs. Although the new system is designed to give students more frequent testing opportunities, hence decreasing the high-stakes testing pressure, it also creates worries about financial constraints, resource deployment, and access for disadvantaged students. By examining these features, the present paper endeavours to make observations about the possible long-term implications of the two-term examination system for Indian education, public policy, and economic tendencies.

### Introduction

Development of school practice and test systems has constantly followed societal transformation, driven both by technological growth and changing teaching principles. As an educator well-bred in the culture of ICT and CS education, I have personally experienced the evolving attitudes towards assessment, learning, and student welfare. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), a key stakeholder in framing educational policies in India, has been a keen contributor to this shift. The shift to a two-term examination system, which will be introduced in the 2025-2026 academic year, is one of the most notable developments in recent years. By providing students with two chances at the examination, the system seeks to alleviate the academic pressure that comes with a single, high-stakes test. Although this change holds the promise of positive benefits, it also provokes relevant questions regarding its economic cost, its feasibility in terms of logistics, and its effects on equity within the education system. This paper addresses these opportunities and challenges within the framework of public policy and economic analysis, suggesting that although the new format holds potential, vigilant attention must be given to make sure it is of benefit to all stakeholders on an equitable basis.

### Background

In the last decade, India has seen a revolutionary shift in its education system, especially in how it conducts exams. The CBSE, or the board conducting exams for millions of students from all over India, has remained at the vanguard of every change. Historically, the CBSE has used a single, high-stakes final examination for students in grades 10 and 12 at the end of every academic year. Although the system has been effective, it has also been a cause of huge stress for students, which has raised issues regarding mental well-being, rote memorization, and the effectiveness of this method of assessment in measuring the richness of student learning.&#x20;

To address these concerns, the CBSE has declared a move to a two-term examination system from the academic year 2025-2026. The move is to take away some of the tension tagged to conventional examinations as students would have two opportunities to prove their understanding of the curriculum throughout the year. The two-term system will also tend to promote ongoing learning, as evaluations take place more regularly and in smaller, more manageable chunks of the syllabus.

The system has been welcomed as a move forward in enhancing student welfare as well as the quality of education. Nevertheless, this change poses enormous logistical problems, economic burdens, and equity issues, especially for economically disadvantaged students who lack the resources to support extra preparation. In addition, the heightened frequency of assessments could pose fiscal burdens on families and schools, who will need to deal with the logistical realities of more frequent testing. Therefore, it is essential to analyze the likely effects of this new system, not merely from the pedagogical point of view, but also from the point of view of economic policy and social justice.&#x20;

In the subsequent sections, this paper will discuss the possibilities and dilemmas of the two-term exam system, considering its possible influence on student learning, educational fairness, and the economy at large. By setting these issues within the context of public policy, the paper will seek to provide an integrated comprehension of the consequences of this considerable educational reform.

### Opportunities

Opportunities in the Two-Term System: A New Path for Students and the Economy The shift towards a two-term exam pattern has initiated discussions, especially among us who have witnessed the effects of exam stress on students over the years. One of the most encouraging sides of this transition is the way it can lead to a decline in stress levels among students. A single examination that is high-stakes feels like the result of years of effort, which makes the final exam burden an unbearable one for most. Through the splitting of the exams into two terms, students are offered several chances to prove their understanding, thus lightening the burden of academic workload throughout the year. This, in theory, should alleviate some of the pressure associated with a single, monumental exam.

From a pedagogical standpoint, this shift could enhance retention. Frequent assessments encourage regular review and retention of material, which has been shown to promote better long-term learning outcomes. Instead of cramming a year's worth of content into one exam period, students are given the chance to demonstrate mastery of smaller chunks of content, resulting in a more meaningful engagement with the curriculum.

But these advantages are not exclusive to students. There are possible economic benefits that are usually not considered. The addition of a new term exam could bring in more revenue for CBSE, in the form of extra exam fees, re-checking fees, and even possibly the requirement for more exam centers or facilities. For an educational institution like CBSE, this change presents an opportunity to balance the financial burdens of administering exams with the broader goals of educational reform. While this may seem like a logistical afterthought, the impact on the education economy could be profound, especially if the system proves successful and is adopted by other boards in the future.

### The Challenges:&#x20;

Unpacking the Costs and Logistical Complexities But no reform is without its challenges, and the two-term system is not an exception. To begin with, the more frequent exams will result in increased expenditure, not just for CBSE but for students' families as well. The extra exam fees, combined with possible re-evaluation or re-checking charges, could put considerable pressure on household budgets, especially for lower-income families. This can worsen the current inequalities in education, wherein access to quality materials and preparation resources is already biased along socioeconomic lines.

Logistically, schools will be under greater pressure. The administrative burden of running exams twice a year, marking them, and coping with the administrative burden may strain already stretched resources. This may create inequalities in the extent to which the system is delivered between schools, with better-off schools perhaps being able to cope with the new system better than those in disadvantaged areas.

In addition, the consequences for students from low-income backgrounds cannot be overlooked. Although the system provides more opportunities for evaluation, it also demands more resources—study materials, tutoring, and time—all of which may not be as easily accessible to students who need them the most. The gap between those who can pay to keep pace with the requirements of the two-term system and those who cannot might grow wider, introducing new disparities in an already unequal system.

#### Economic Implications:&#x20;

A Broader View of Revenue and Enrollment The economic implications of the two-term exam pattern are also to be looked at in detail. Although the rise in exam charges may bring instant money for CBSE, its long-term impact is multifaceted. More expense for parents may possibly lower enrollment, particularly among the economically weaker sections. Second, the growing intensity of examinations could trigger the increase in demand for private education tutoring services to build a side market for education aimed at helping students gain the advantage in this emerging exam culture.

An economic consideration of the entire educational ecosystem further shows that the changes will provoke a turn towards more privatization in education. As parents look to offset the pressures and possible expenses of the new two-term system, they might resort to private schools or online learning sites that provide customized assistance for the two-term model. This would lead to a higher demand for ed-tech solutions, which in turn would create opportunities and challenges in the ICT and CS industries as well.

### Future Projections:&#x20;

Will the Two-Term System Become a National Model? Looking ahead, the success or failure of the two-term exam strategy would have far-reaching consequences. If the system becomes effective in cutting stress and enhancing learning achievement, it will be taken as a template by other Indian education boards and may shape national education policy. The impact of the system may also bleed into economic policy, especially in the form of resource allocation for educational facilities and the funding of public education.

If the model is emulated by other boards or educational institutions, a ripple effect would be created in how public policy approaches educational reforms. The revenue generated from increased exam fees, coupled with the possibility of an involved and less anxious student base, could become a compelling argument for the nationalization of the system, and its effects on the public education system and economy as a whole.

### Conclusion:&#x20;

A Delicate Balance The two-term exam system, as conceptualized by CBSE, has both huge opportunities and challenges. While it has the potential to minimize stress, enhance retention, and offer economic advantages for the examination board, it also brings in logistical challenges, cost implications for families, and equity issues for students from weaker sections. Having myself traversed the dynamic landscape of ICT and CS education, I appreciate the importance of thoughtful deliberation and forward planning in undertaking reforms. To be successful, CBSE's two-term strategy will need to take a multifaceted approach that tackles these issues while optimally leveraging the benefits for all concerned.

Ultimately, the two-term system is more than a change in the exam schedule—it is a demonstration of how education, public policy, and economic concerns are inexorably entwined to forge the future of learning in India.
